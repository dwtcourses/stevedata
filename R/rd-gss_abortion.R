#' Abortion Opinions in the General Social Survey (1972-2018)
#'
#' This is a toy data set derived from the General Social Survey that I intend
#' to use for several purposes. First, the battery of abortion items can serve as
#' toy data to illustrate mixed effects modeling as equivalent to a
#' one-parameter (Rasch) model. Second, I include some covariates to also do some
#' basic regressions. I think abortion opinions are useful learning tools for
#' statistical inference for college students.
#'
