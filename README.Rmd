# Steve's Toy Data

`stevedata` is an R package full of toy data sets that you may find useful for your own purposes. Namely, I've created probably over a hundred toy data sets along the way, either to riff on some topic on [my blog](http://svmiller.com/blog), show my students something in one of [my many classes](http://svmiller.com/teaching), or just to entertain myself for [spamming Twitter with my assorted thoughts](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller). I had stuffed a lot of these into [`stevemisc`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc), but I want to keep that package mostly about the functions (and whatever data are useful for showing off the functions). `stevedata` will have all my toy data going forward.

## Installation

The goal is to get this on CRAN, eventually. Until then, you can install the development version of `stevedata` from Github via the `devtools` package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would work as well.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevedata")
```

## Usage

The usage, as of writing, is minimal. This should be a pretty rich data package when I'm done with it. Until then, you can do this to see what's in it.

```r
data(package = "stevedata")
```

The ensuing output will look like this.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
alldata <- data(package = "stevedata")
library(knitr)
library(tibble)

tibble(`**Object Name**` = alldata$results[, "Item"],
       `**Title/Description**` = alldata$results[, "Title"]) %>%
  kable(., format="markdown")
```

Here is a simple scraping job to provide more information (by way of the `description` field in the associated R Documentation file).

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
getdescript <- function(package){
  db <- tools::Rd_db(package)
  descript <- lapply(db,function(x) {
    tags <- tools:::RdTags(x)
    if("\\description" %in% tags){
      out <- paste(unlist(x[which(tags=="\\description")]),collapse="")
    }
    else
      out <- NULL
    invisible(out)
  })
  gsub("\n","",unlist(descript))
}

descripts <- getdescript("stevedata")

tibble(`**Object Name**` = alldata$results[, "Item"],
       `**Description**` = descripts)  %>%
  kable(., format="markdown")

```
