`stevedata` is an R package full of toy data sets that you may find
useful for various purposes. Namely, I’ve created probably over a
hundred toy data sets along the way, either to riff on some topic on [my
blog](http://svmiller.com/blog/), show my students something in one of
[my many classes](http://svmiller.com/teaching/), or just to entertain
myself for [spamming Twitter with my assorted
thoughts](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller). I had stuffed a lot of
these into [`stevemisc`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc), but I
want to keep that package mostly about the functions (and whatever data
are useful for showing off the functions). `stevedata` will have all my
toy data going forward.

I anticipate two sets of R users may find these data useful. First,
instructors may find these data useful for classes on a variety of
topics, but prominently quantitative methods and international
relations. Many of the toy data sets included in this R package are data
I’ve acquired or assembled to teach about topics in quantitative methods
or international relations in a reproducible way. Users should see my
Github repositories for my classes on [introduction to international
relations](https://github.com/svmiller/posc1020), [quantitative methods
in political science](https://github.com/svmiller/posc3410), and
[foundations of social science research for public
policy](https://github.com/svmiller/post8000) to see how I’ve used these
data (or development versions of them). Topics here are diverse,
including (but not limited to) [carbon dioxide emissions over 800,000
years](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/co2emissions.Rd)
(as an illustration of climate change), [coffee
prices](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/coffee_price.Rd)
(as an illustration of the worsening [terms of
trade](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Terms_of_trade.html#:~:text=A%20worsening%20terms%20of%20trade,the%20price%20of%20manufactured%20goods.)),
[the justifiability of
bribe-taking](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/wvs_justifbribe.Rd)
(as an illustration of information-poor and discrete variables that a
researcher may be tempted to treat as drawn from a normal distribution),
the canonical case of [illiteracy rates in the 1930 U.S.
Census](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/illiteracy30.Rd)
(as an illustration of an [ecological
fallacy](https://www.britannica.com/science/ecological-fallacy)), and
many, many more topics.

Second, my students in these classes (but especially my methods classes)
should find this R package useful. I will also be having my methods
students (undergraduate and graduate) download this package to work
through problem sets in the R programming language. It’d be a benefit to
them (and less hassle/headache for myself) to have my students download
this package from CRAN rather than work through potential
[`curl`](https://curl.se) issues by installing through Github.

In almost all instances, each data set has an underlying code/script
that generates them. These are in a `data-raw` directory that is not
included in the Github repository or the R package. However, I invite
users to reach out with questions about the data if they have them.

## Installation

The goal is to get this on CRAN, eventually. Until then, you can install
the development version of `stevedata` from Github via the `devtools`
package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would work as well.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevedata")
```

## Usage

The data set already has a lot to offer those who might be curious about
its contents. You can do this to see what is in it.

``` r
data(package = "stevedata")
```

The ensuing output will look like this.

Here is a simple scraping job to provide more information (by way of the
`description` field in the associated R Documentation file). I include
these descriptions as a vignette as well.

These data are useful for me in teaching how Trump’s 2018 steel tariffs didn’t do much good for the steel industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `CFT15`                 | This is the replication data for “Randomization Inference in the Regression Discontinuity Design: An Application to Party Advantages in the U.S. Senate”, published in 2015 in Journal of Causal Inference. I use these data to teach about regression discontinuity designs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `CP77`                  | This is a simple data set provided by Chatterjee and Price (1977, p. 108) that serves as a known example of heteroscedasticity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `DJIA`                  | This data set contains the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on daily close for all available dates (to the best of my knowledge) from 1885 to the most recently concluded calendar year. Extensions shouldn’t be too difficult with existing packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `DST`                   | These are fatalities (and, in the case of terrorism, casualties as well) for drunk-driving, suicide, and acts of terrorism in the U.S. spanning 1970 to 2018. Only one of these is sufficiently important to command public attention despite being the least severe public bad. Do you want to guess which one?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Datasaurus`            | An illustrative exercise in never trusting the summary statistics without also visualizing them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Dee04`                 | This should be a data set for a (partial?) replication of Dee’s (2004) article on the purported civics returns to education. I use these data for in-class illustration about instrumental variable analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `ESS9GB`                | This is a replication data originally set to accompany a blog post and presentation to students at the University of Nottingham in March 2020. However, COVID-19 led to the cancellation of the talk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `ESSBE5`                | This is a sample data set cobbled from the fifth round of European Social Survey data for Belgium. It offers a means to do a basic replication of some of Chapter 5 of The SAGE Handbook of Regression Analysis and Causal Inference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Guber99`               | A data set for a canonical case of a Simpson’s paradox, useful for in-class instruction on the topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `LOTI`                  | These data contain monthly mean temperature anomalies expressed as deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means. They are useful for showing how we can measure climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `LTPT`                  | These data are a monthly time-series of changes in the consumer price index relative to a Dec. 1997 starting date for televisions, computers, and related items. I use this as in-class illustration that globalization has made consumer electronics cheaper across the board for Americans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `LTWT`                  | These data contain price indices for various items for the general urban consumer. Categories include medical services, college tuition, college textbooks, child care, housing, food and beverages, all items (i.e. general CPI), new vehicles, apparel, and televisions. The base period in value was originally the 1982-4 average, but I converted the base period to January 2000. I use these data for in-class discussion about how liberalized trade has made consumer electronics (like TVs) fractions of their past prices. Yet, young adults face mounting costs for college, child-raising, and health care that government policy has failed to address. |
| `Newhouse77`            | These are the data in Newhouse’s (1977) simple OLS model from 1977. In his case, he’s trying to explain medical care expenditures as a function of GDP per capita for these countries. It’s probably the easiest OLS model I can find in print because Newhouse helpfully provides all the data in one simple table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ODGI`                  | The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory has an “ozone depleting gas index” (ODGI) data set from 1992 to 2018. This dataset summarizes Table 1 and Table 2 from its website. The primary interest here (for my purposes) is the ODGI indices (including the new 2012 measure). The data set includes constituent greenhouse gases/chlorines as well in parts per trillion. The primary use here is for in-class illustration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Presidents`            | This should be self-evident. Here are all U.S. presidents who have completed their terms in office (i.e. excluding the current one).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `TV16`                  | These data come from the 2016 CCES and allow interested students to model the individual correlates of the Trump vote in 2016. Code/analysis heavily indebted to a 2017 analysis I did on my blog (see references).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `aluminum_premiums`     | A near daily data set on the price of aluminum premiums (USD/MT) for LME in the U.S., Western Europe, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. I like these data as illustrative of some of the shortsightedness of the aluminum tariffs that Donald Trump announced in March 2018. The tariffs had no discernible effect on manufacturing employment or earnings, but they created a supply shock that made aluminum more expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `anes_prochoice`        | A simple data set for in-class illustration about how to estimate and interpret interactive relationships. The data here are deliberately minimal for that end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `asn_stats`             | These are yearly counts on air accidents and fatalities, including measures for corporate jet accidents and hijackings. The hijackings are of particular interest to me, at least from a historical terrorism perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `clemson_temps`         | This data set contains daily temperatures (highs) for Clemson, South Carolina from Jan. 1, 1930 to the end of the most recent calendar year. The goal is to update this periodically with new data for as long as I live in this town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `co2emissions`          | This is a sample data set, cobbled from various sources, about carbon dioxide emissions in the history of the planet from 800,000 BCE to the most recently concluded calendar year. I use this for a data visualization example for a lecture on climate change and international politics. Data communicate yearly averages/estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `coffee_imports`        | A simple time series on coffee imports for select importing countries (i.e. European Union + Japan + Russia + Tunisia + United States).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `coffee_price`          | This is primary commodity price data for coffee (Arabica, Robustas) from 1980 to the present. I manually update these data since FRED’s coverage since 2017 has been spotty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `election_turnout`      | A simple data set on education and state-level (+ DC) turnout in the 2016 presidential election.

The outcome y is a linear function of a baseline for each hypothetical country, plus a yearly growth trend as well as varying growth errors for each country. x1 is supposed to have a linear effect of .5 on y, all things considered. x2 is supposed to have a linear effect of 1 on y for each unit change in x2, all things considered.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `fakeTSD`               | This is a toy (i.e. “fake”) data set created by the fabricatr package. There are 100 observations. The outcome y is a linear function of 20 + (.25 \* year) + .(25 \* x1) + (1 \* x2) + e. This clearly implies some autocorrelation in the data. I.e. it’s a time-series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `gss_abortion`          | This is a toy data set derived from the General Social Survey that I intend to use for several purposes. First, the battery of abortion items can serve as toy data to illustrate mixed effects modeling as equivalent to a one-parameter (Rasch) model. Second, I include some covariates to also do some basic regressions. I think abortion opinions are useful learning tools for statistical inference for college students. Third, there’s a time-series component as well for understanding how abortion attitudes have changed over time.                                                                                                                     |
| `gss_spending`          | This is a toy data set that collects attitudes on toward national spending for various things in the General Social Survey for 2018.

Note that the national standard is 75 parts per billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `steves_clothes`        | I cobbled together this data set of the professional clothes (polos, long-sleeve dress shirts, pants) in my closet, largely for illustration on the origins of apparel in the U.S. for an intro lecture on trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `sugar_price`           | This is primary commodity price data for sugar globally, in the United States, and in Europe for every month from 1980 to (roughly) the present. Prices are nominal U.S. cents per pound and are not seasonally adjusted (“NSA”).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `therms`                | A data set on thermometer ratings for Donald Trump and Barack Obama in 2020. I use these data for in-class illustration of central limit theorem. Basically: the sampling distribution of a population is normal, even if the underlying population is decidedly not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `uniondensity`          | Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and predictors in 20 countries. This is a data set of interest to replicating Western and Jackman (1994), who themselves were addressing a debate between Wallerstein and Stephens on which of two highly correlated predictors explains trade union density.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `usa_chn_gdp_forecasts` | This is a toy data set to examine the time in which we should expect China to overtake the United States in total gross domestic product (GDP), given current trends. It includes an OECD long-term GDP forecast from 2014, and forecasts from the forecast and prophet packages in R.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `usa_states`            | A simple data set from state.abb, state.name, state.region, and state.division (+ District of Columbia). I’d rather just have all these in one place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `wvs_ccodes`            | A simple data set that syncs World Values Survey country codes (s003) with corresponding country codes from the Correlates of War state system membership data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `wvs_immig`             | A data set on attitudes about immigration for all observations in the third to sixth wave of the World Values Survey.
