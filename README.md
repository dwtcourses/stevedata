# Steve’s Toy Data

`stevedata` is an R package full of toy data sets that you may find
useful for your own purposes. Namely, I’ve created probably over a
hundred toy data sets along the way, either to riff on some topic on [my
blog](http://svmiller.com/blog), show my students something in one of
[my many classes](http://svmiller.com/teaching), or just to entertain
myself for [spamming Twitter with my assorted
thoughts](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller). I had stuffed a lot of
these into [`stevemisc`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc), but I
want to keep that package mostly about the functions (and whatever data
are useful for showing off the functions). `stevedata` will have all my
toy data going forward.

## Installation

The goal is to get this on CRAN, eventually. Until then, you can install
the development version of `stevedata` from Github via the `devtools`
package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would work as well.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevedata")
```

## Usage

The usage, as of writing, is minimal. This should be a pretty rich data
package when I’m done with it. Until then, you can do this to see what’s
in it.

``` r
data(package = "stevedata")
```

The ensuing output will look like this.

| LTWT                     | These data contain price indices for various items for the general urban consumer. Categories include medical services, college tuition, college textbooks, child care, housing, food and beverages, all items (i.e. general CPI), new vehicles, apparel, and televisions. The base period in value was originally the 1982-4 average, but I converted the base period to January 2000. I use these data for in-class discussion about how liberalized trade has made consumer electronics (like TVs) fractions of their past prices. Yet, young adults face mounting costs for college, child-raising, and health care that government policy has failed to address. |
| ODGI                     | The NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory has an “ozone depleting gas index” (ODGI) data set from 1992 to 2018.

| aluminum\_premiums       | A near daily data set on the price of aluminum premiums (USD/MT) for LME in the U.S., Western Europe, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. I like these data as illustrative of some of the shortsightedness of the aluminum tariffs that Donald Trump announced in March 2018. The tariffs had no discernible effect on manufacturing employment or earnings, but they created a supply shock that made aluminum more expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| asn\_stats               | These are yearly counts on air accidents and fatalities, including measures for corporate jet accidents and hijackings.

| gss\_abortion            | This is a toy data set derived from the General Social Survey that I intend to use for several purposes. First, the battery of abortion items can serve as toy data to illustrate mixed effects modeling as equivalent to a one-parameter (Rasch) model. Second, I include some covariates to also do some basic regressions. I think abortion opinions are useful learning tools for statistical inference for college students. Third, there’s a time-series component as well for understanding how abortion attitudes have changed over time.                                                                                                                     |
